# Reveal

Will reveal the destination element from the origin size to the destination size using `clip-path` only which will not work for IE11.

## Usage

```js
import { Reveal } from '@element-motion/core';
```

## Props

<Props of={Reveal} />

## Caveats

Be careful of collapsing margins when utilising this motion,
they will make the destination element jump around,
probably.
If you're seeing some odd behavior - maybe try a flex container instead.
