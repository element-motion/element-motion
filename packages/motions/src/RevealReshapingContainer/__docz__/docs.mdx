                  : `Washed tripe is more typically known as dressed tripe. To dress the tripe, the stomachs are cleaned and the fat trimmed off.[4] It is then boiled and bleached, giving it the white color more commonly associated with tripe as seen on market stalls and in butchers shops. The task of dressing the tripe is usually carried out by a professional tripe dresser. Dressed tripe was a popular, nutritious and cheap dish for the British working classes from Victorian times until the latter half of the 20th century.[5][6][7] While it is still popular in many parts of the world today, the number of tripe eaters, and consequently the number of tripe dressers, in the UK has rapidly declined. Tripe has come to be regarded as a pet food, as the increased affluence of postwar Britain has reduced the appeal of this once staple food.`}

<Props of={ReshapingContainer} />

## Caveats

Be careful of collapsing margins when utilising this motion,
they will make the destination element jump around when revealing,
probably.
If you're seeing some odd behavior - maybe try a flex container instead.
