# What are focal motions?

Focal motions are all about a single focal element that we want to transition from one state to another.
While multiple elements _may_ be utilised in a focal motion (e.g. how [FocalRevealMove](/focal-reveal-move) works),
the motions are always interested in a single focal element.
