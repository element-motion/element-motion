# element motion

formerly yubaba, element motion for [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) 💨✨

## Why element motion?

It's all about ✨**motion over state transitions** ✨ - it can help with:

- 📴 Enabling motion to be possible between two disconnected elements in the React tree
- 🚚 [Moving an element](/move) from one location to another
- 💨 [Revealing elements](/focal-reveal-move) inside another element
- 👓 [Supporting motions](/supporting-motions) by obstructing elements in view
- 🤫 [Hiding child elements](/advanced-usage#delay-showing-content-until-all-motions-have-finished) until all motions have completed
- 🔢 [Orchestrating](/advanced-usage#wait-for-the-previous-motion-to-finish-before-starting-the-next) when motions should start and [in what order](/advanced-usage#controlling-in-what-order-motions-should-execute)
- 📝 Composing motions together to create composites, for example [CrossFadeMove](/cross-fade-move)
- 🤯 [Anything you can imagine](/custom-motions), seriously

## Installation

```bash
npm install @element-motion/core react react-dom emotion --save
```

or

```bash
yarn add @element-motion/core react react-dom emotion
```

React should be greater or equal to `v16.4`, emotion should be greater or equal to `v9`.

> **Tip -** Both es and commonjs modules are provided in the package.
> Make sure to consume the es modules in production for their tree shaking ability!

## Usage

```js
import Motion, { Move } from '@element-motion/core';

({ isLarge }) => (
  <Motion triggerSelfKey={isLarge}>
    <Move>{motion => <div {...motion} className={isLarge ? 'large' : 'small'} />}</Move>
  </Motion>
);
```
