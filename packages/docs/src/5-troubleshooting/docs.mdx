# Troubleshooting

## Motions aren't starting

Sometimes an [Motion](/motion) element is reused by React if the markup where the [Motion](/motion) element was rendered didn't change.
If you're rendering two different trees get around this by using [React `key` prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) to force each [Motion](/motion) to re-mount.
Else think about using the `triggerSelfKey` prop for self targetting.

## TypeError: Cannot read property 'getBoundingClientRect' of undefined

Your target `ref` is probably not being set correctly.
Double check your [Motion](/motion) elements.

> ** Tip -** If you're having trouble getting ahold of a `ref` think about adding some extra wrapper markup.

```diff
<Motion>
  {motion => (
+    <div {...motion}>
+      <MyComponent />
-      <MyComponent {...motion} />
+    </div>
  )}
</Motion>
```
