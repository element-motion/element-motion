# Element Motion

This has been archived.
If you're looking for a solid implementation of an animation engine/FLIP style animations that are easy to use I highly recommend checking out Framer Motion.

The latest update with the `animate` prop truly is the nail in the coffin for Element Motion - it does everything this library does and more with a fantastic API.
